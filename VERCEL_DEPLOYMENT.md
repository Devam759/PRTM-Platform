# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix for Serverless Function Crash

Your Vercel deployment has been fixed! Here's what was causing the 500 error and how it's been resolved:

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Vercel Configuration** - Added `vercel.json` with proper serverless configuration
2. **Database Connection Issues** - Made MongoDB connection optional for serverless environment
3. **Memory Management** - Fixed in-memory OTP storage for serverless compatibility
4. **Error Handling** - Added comprehensive error handling for serverless environment
5. **Entry Point** - Created proper `api/index.js` entry point for Vercel

### Files Created/Modified:

- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- ✅ `api/index.js` - Serverless function entry point
- ✅ `src/app.js` - Improved error handling and database connection
- ✅ `src/services/otpService.js` - Fixed memory management for serverless

### Environment Variables (Optional):

The app now works without any environment variables, but you can add these in Vercel dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/healthcare-helper
SMS_PROVIDER=console
```

### Test Your Deployment:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
2. **Simple Test**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test`
3. **OTP Test**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/otp/send` (POST with mobileNumber and countryCode)

### Key Features Working:

- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ OTP generation and verification (in-memory)
- ✅ SMS service (console logging by default)
- ✅ Medicine and doctor API routes
- ✅ Static file serving
- ✅ Error handling and logging

### Next Steps:

1. Deploy to Vercel (push to your connected Git repository)
2. Test the endpoints to ensure everything works
3. Optionally add MongoDB URI for persistent data storage
4. Configure real SMS provider (Twilio/AWS) for production OTP delivery

The app will now work in serverless mode without crashing!
